# Student-s-DataBase
A Simple Database Management System.
THIS IS COMPLETELY A CUI BASED PROJECT.

Realworld Problem :- 


There is a computer instituition where there are 11 computers and classes are held daily.
Here the program is intended to manage and keep all the records of the students studying there...
EACH STUDENTS GETS TWO CLASSES IN A WEEK...ONE MIGHT DO A SINGLE CLASS IN A WEEK


The program works like this....

1]firstly it accepts what a user wants to do that is whether he/she wants to ADD,DELETE,EDIT,SEARCH,DISPLAY WHOLE DATABASE

2]secondly if the user selects to add then it displays the days i.e SATURDAY,SUNDAY..........FRIDAY

3]then after the user selects the day then the program will ask for the timing...(there is a condition that in a particular time only 11 students can be accomodated)...so it will check whether the a time is available or not....and if the time is available then only it displays that timing in the terminal window...for the selection

4]now when the time is selected then again the program display the days of the week....for second class

5] the user can also skip that process

6] if the user selects the timing of the second class then the program will accept the student's details...or if the user skips(selection for second class) then it then simply accepts student's details.

7] when the students details is accepted then the accepted data is inserted to the main database..

8] then program again goes to (see step 1)..

9]if the user wants to dlete the database then it simply searchs for the uid and if the uid is present it prompts for confirmation then the database of that particular student is deleted...and process will again go to step 1

10] if the user wants to edit the then its asks the fields to be edited....and then after the editing is completed then it puts the edited entry in the main database (deleting the previous records of that particular uid)....and then it goes to step 1

11] if the user wants to search then user must enter the uid and the results will we display according to thr saved database.

12]  if the user wantes to display the current database then the program will display the complete database...and after the process is completed then the program will return to step 1.

13] in each of the mentioned step there will be an option to terminate the process.....
